FILE GUIDE

There are various directories included in this submission.  Their contents are as follows:

translation_tool: Translation tool and tests.  See README contained within this file for instructions on how to run.
    -in: DSL source code.  The files in this directory represent the currently supported functionality for the translation tool. 
        (Includes DSL for this project's targeted programs)
    -out: output directory for C produced by the translation tool.
    -test_output: output directory for c tests
        -runtime_checks: Testing for bounds checking stopping execution
        -led_dsl: Generates and compiles LED and runs all test vectors through program
        -lfsr_dsl: Generates and compiles LFSR and runs all test vectors through program
        -present_dsl: Generates and compiles PRESENT and runs all test vectors through program
        -prince_dsl: Generates and compiles PRINCE and runs all test vectors through program
        -general_dsl: Generates and compiles non-critical functionality

data: Result data presented in report & tools created in python to analyse data.
    -indiv_runs: data for analysis of individual runs (execution time of 1000 runs of ciphers.)
        -opt: data relating to optimised versions of translation output
        -hw: data relating to handwritten versions
    -mean_runs: data used for analysis of cipher run times.  (Execution time of 1000000 runs of ciphers.)
        -v1: data relating to unoptimised versions of translation output
        -opt: data relating to optimised versions of translation output
