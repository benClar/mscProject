FILE GUIDE

There are various directories included in this submission.  Their contents are as follows:

####################
###Implementation###
####################
translation_tool: Translation tool and tests.  See README contained within this file for instructions on how to run.
	-README.txt: explanation of how to use tool and run tests
    -in: DSL source code.  The files in this directory represent the currently supported functionality for the translation tool. 
        (Includes DSL for this project's targeted programs)
		-README.txt: Explanation of demo DSL code provided & functionality that is represented
    -out: output directory for C produced by the translation tool.
    -test_output: output directory for c tests
        -runtime_checks: Testing for bounds checking stopping execution
        -led_dsl: Generates and compiles LED and runs all test vectors through program
        -lfsr_dsl: Generates and compiles LFSR and runs all test vectors through program
        -present_dsl: Generates and compiles PRESENT and runs all test vectors through program
